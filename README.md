# NBA Fan Engagement for Nike

This is a project from the course ***Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing*** which is a part of **Hult's MSc. in Business Analytics program in Boston**.

The project covers these **NLP fundamentals** but is not limited to them:

- Load and subset data
- Clean text (remove stop words, emojis, punctuation, numbers, contractions, etc)
- User-Defined Functions
- Create Document Term/Term Document matrix
- Look for word associations, word counts, word clouds and insightful data vizualization tools
- Generate insights

## Goal: 

Your boss are interested in learning more about the commentary for popular teams, athletes, or the league as a whole. Additionally, examining the sentiment and polarity for your analysis will benefit the marketing team's efforts helping them understand where to allocate spend. At the conclusion of your analysis you need to present your findings in a slide deck to the marketing team, keep in mind they are qualitative so your analysis should describe the data, processing and methods employed, not just the results.

### insights:

- Nike maintained its leadership in the NBA Twitter Fandom, as shown by leading share of voice againts it top competitor Adidas.
- Despite being a retired athlete, Michael Jordan has been incredibly popular in the NBA twitter due to the release of the ESPN documentary 'The Last Dance'. This could have been predicted by Nike and used in its favour given the close relationship with the Jordan Brand.
- Covid-19 affected the sports world. 'Streaming' has become an even more popular topic, opening new opportunities for advertising channels.
- More active engagement of youth with cultural movements like BLM. Nike has been known for taking a stance in topics of social justice.
- Words associated with Nike's NXT shoes open space for further improvements.
